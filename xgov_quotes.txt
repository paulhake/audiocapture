Here is the most important quote:

"end to end governance program platform, which is consolidated around risk and compliance and model management capabilities."
"We expect in second half of this year, the WatsonX governance standard plan, which is combining risk console and model management capabilities."
"One of the core elements that our clients are looking to drive towards is the idea of being able to manage and understand their compliance posture. Where do they sit within the growing regulation footprint across the world?"
Here is the most important quote from the text:

"We'd look to maybe onboard the different types of foundation models. Is it Grok? Is it Granite? It's a DeepSeek R1, whatever you've chosen as being your organization's element..."

"So what it is, just to be clear, it's data as a service."
"We have a library of compliance plans and then distributed compliance plans. The additional ones are those that are being assessed at the use case level."
"So for example, here I can see for New York City 144. We actually have 5% of our obligations have been met and only 5% have been assessed."
"So you'd be able to link through to those metrics that you're evaluating as part of the rest of what's next governance."
"So all the different elements of risk information, use case details, but you'll now see some different elements under here."
Here is the most important quote:

"You see a compliance evaluation... Rahul has 70 different things he has to do. 70 obligations he needs to confirm."

 Plain text: "You see a compliance evaluation... Rahul has 70 different things he has to do. 70 obligations he needs to confirm."
"So if there was a cross-over between these 20 and 50, it would be far more harmonized."

Here's the most important quote extracted from the text:

"When I say how many experiments are run, it's basically every time that a user clicks on that run experiment."

Plain text:
"So if you look at 10 experiments per month times 15 is about 150 resource units at 60 cents a resource unit. That's $90 per month or $90 per month."
"reach out to product management if you need help in some sizing or figuring out what to do with the guardrails."
"We want to act upon and really we want to approach our enterprise clients and position Watson X-Governance with IBMC."

"Fusion can be a great option across all the AI offerings."
"So the idea here is to make this configuration super easy to do and also really facilitate interaction between the Fusion teams and the Watson X teams as well, working through common tooling in order to address the customer use cases and the customer requirements as well."
"So the teams will still focus on the areas that they have focused on in the past. But the idea is the teams work together and it's sort of a better together story with tooling, in this case the configurator tooling, supporting both sides."
Here's the extracted quote in plain text:

"When these things are put together and hardware is included, these deals can be quite large and certainly can be advantageous both for us and for the customer as well..."
